# About
Test. A simple word with explicit meaning that nobody can't argue with it. However, it's not easy to apply in a practical way in your project/product. You can go through your whole product in a whole day, **test** everything on its and sign off testing is done, that's the theory.

This repository target to contains test materials conducted to test deployed shopping cart website including test repository. No best practices are aimed to include here, just a journey of me conducting tests and:
- To practice testing on a real website which all known testing aspect that I've learn which basic funtionalities are included
- To apply E2E test
- To use different automation tools/solutions.
**But the ultimate goal is to answer this concern: To determine the status of the current AUT version**
